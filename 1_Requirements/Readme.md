# Requirements


## Introduction


A fully featured scientific calculator with proper operator
precedence is implemented, including trig functions and
logarithms, factorials, 12 levels of parentheses, logs to base 2
(a handy function for information entropists!), bitwise logical
operators, hex, octal, binary and ASCII display.


# BASIC FUNCTIONS

## Addition
The addition (sum function) is used by clicking on the "+" button or using the keyboard. The
function results in a+b.
## Subtraction
The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard.
The function results in a-b.
## Multiplication
The multiplication (times function) is used by clicking on the "x" button or using the keyboard
"*" key. The function results in a*b.
## Division
The division (divide function) is used by clicking on the "/" button or using the keyboard "/"
key. The function results in a/b.
## Sign
The sign key (negative key) is used by clicking on the "(-)" button. The function results in -1*x.
## Square
The square function is used by clicking on the "x^2" button or type "^2". The function results in
x*x.
## Square Root
The square root function is used by clicking on the "x" button or type "sqrt()". This
function represents x^.5 where the result squared is equal to x.
## Raise to the Power
The raise to the power (y raised to the x function) is used by clicking on the "y^x" button or
type "^".
## Natural Exponential
The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by clicking on the "e^x" button or
type "exp()". The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x.
## Logarithm
The logarithm (LOG) is used by clicking on the "LOG" button or type "LOG()".
## Natural Logarithm
The Natural logarithm (LN) is used by clicking on the "LN" button or type "LN()".
## Inverse
Multiplicative inverse (reciprocal function) is used by pressing the "1/x" button or
typing "inv()". This function is the same as x^-1 or dividing 1 by the number.
## Exponent
Numbers with exponents of 10 are displayed with an "e", for example 4.5e+100 or 4.5e-100.
This function represents 10^x. Numbers are automatically displayed in the format when the
number is too large or too small for the display. To enter a number in this format use the
exponent key "EEX". To do this enter the mantissa (the non exponent part) then press "EEX" or
type"e" and then enter the exponent.
## Factorial
The Factorial function is used by clicking the "!" button or type "!".
## PI
PI is a mathematical constant of the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
